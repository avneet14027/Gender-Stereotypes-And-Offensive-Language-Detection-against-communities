### Motivation
Over the years, there has been a constant growth in  online social media as a platform to directly voice public opinions. 
While that has a great advantage of social connectivity around the globe, the content that is put on such platforms, 
needs to be checked and regulated for instances of threats, abusive language, hate speech content etc., and at the same time, 
not capture the freedom of people using it as a means of expression. There has been a longstanding debate on censorship of content on 
online social media and a significant amount of work has been done to prevent malicious content from being surfaced online.

It has often been seen, that certain groups of people are targeted based on ethnicity, gender, race, caste, colour, 
creed, nationality and plenty of other such reasons, and one such group is LGBTQ community which has often become the victim 
of online harassment and stereotypical judgements on popular platforms like Twitter, Facebook etc, and their sentiments are hurt. 

The reason for this study is to identify  these posts and the attackers as well as their malicious intents through the tweets that 
they post online, which could possibly lead us to coming up with solutions to prevent and block such attackers permanently, in order 
to protect the interests of the LGBTQ community, and many other groups.
